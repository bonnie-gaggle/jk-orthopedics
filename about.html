    <h1>About Us</h1>
    <section>
      As a member of the rehabilitation health care team, we work closely with the referring physician, therapist and case
      manager. On-site fabrication enables us to ensure an exceptionally well-fitting device in a timely manner. Privileges at
      neighboring hospitals and rehab centers enhance continuity of care. Effective communication between practitioner and
      patient is also vital. We have staff members fluent in <strong>Spanish, Vietnamese, Tagalog and English</strong>.
